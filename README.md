# windows-music-library
Range of pre-calculated notes using the windows.h file function Beep(). This was created due to an earlier project of mine--16th&Oak--where I made a small melody in the opening scene of the game. The hope is to open-source this library to others to play around with and make their own music.

## Getting Started

0. Own a Windows PC
1. Clone the repository onto said Windows PC
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your Windows PC
3. Navigate to the "yourMusic" directory
4. Open "yourFirstSong.cpp" in your favorite text editor
5. Make music! Good luck!
