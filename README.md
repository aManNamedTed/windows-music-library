# windows-music-library
Range of pre-calculated notes using the windows.h file function [Beep()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms679277(v=vs.85).aspx). This was created due to an earlier project of mine, 16th&Oak, where I made a small melody in the opening scene of the game. The hope is to open-source this library to others to play around with and make their own music. Happy composing!

## Getting Started

0. Own a Windows PC
1. Clone the repository onto said Windows PC
2. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your Windows PC
3. Navigate to the "yourMusic" directory
4. Open "yourFirstSong.cpp" in your favorite text editor
5. Make music! Good luck!

## Usage

Check out the sample music in the "sampleMusic" directory for how to format your music.
Don't forget to compile and run on a Windows PC!
